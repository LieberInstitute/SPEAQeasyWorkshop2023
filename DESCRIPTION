Description: This package introduces SPEAQeasy, an RNA-seq processing pipeline 
            that generates manageable R objects ready for usage in downstream
            analyses. As an example of its usage and usefulness, a Differential 
            Expression Analysis will be performed on a real bulk RNA-seq dataset 
            directly generated from the pipeline.
