# Overview

**TODO**
This workshop aims to present the `SPEAQeasy` `r Citep(bib[["SPEAQeasy"]])` RNA-seq processing pipeline, demonstrating how its outputs can be used in Differential Expression Analyses (DEA) and the type of results it enables to obtain using other Bioconductor R packages such as `r Biocpkg('limma')`, `r Biocpkg('edgeR')`, and `r Biocpkg('clusterProfiler')`.

Briefly describe what is it , etc ... 


## Description

**TODO**
In this demo, participants will be able to understand what the pipeline does 
and what it returns through a Differential Expression Analysis performed on a SPEAQeasy 
dataset from the `smokingMouse` `r Citep(bib[["smokingMouse"]])` Bioconductor package 
which contains gene expression data and sample information from an RNA-sequencing 
experiment in mice.

## Workshop goals and objectives

**TODO**
List "big picture" student-centered workshop goals and learning
objectives. Learning goals and objectives are related, but not the
same thing. These goals and objectives will help some people to decide
whether to attend the conference for training purposes, so please make
these as precise and accurate as possible.

*Learning goals* 
are high-level descriptions of what
participants will learn and be able to do after the workshop is
over. 
*Learning objectives*, on the other hand, describe in very
specific and measurable terms specific skills or knowledge
attained. The [Bloom's Taxonomy](#bloom) may be a useful framework
for defining and describing your goals and objectives, although there
are others.

## Data overview and download 

The dataset that will be used for the DEA can be downloaded from the `smokingMouse` package. 
Visit [here](http://research.libd.org/smokingMouse/) for more details of this package.


<img src="figs/Data_overview_experiments.jpg" width="750px"  />
    <figcaption style="color: gray; line-height: 0.85; text-align: justify"><font size="-2"><b>Figure 1</b>: <b>Experimental design of the study. </b> The data was obtained from an experiment in which <b>A)</b> 6 pregnant dams and 17 non-pregnant female adult mice were administered nicotine by intraperitoneal injection (IP; n=12) or controls (n=11). A total of 42 pups were born to pregnant dams: 19 were born to mice that were administered nicotine and 23 to control mice. Samples from frontal cortices of P0 pups and adults were obtained. <b>B)</b> RNA was extracted from those samples and then RNA-seq libraries were prepared and sequenced to obtain the expression counts of the genes. At the end, a dataset of 65 samples (either from adult or pup brain) and 55,401 genes was generated. </font>

### 1. Data preparation {-}
Even before exploring the samples, the first step is to normalize the counts and filter non-expressed genes; we won't do the processes themselves since we already have normalized and filtered data but let's check why these steps are important and where to extract the data we need for posterior analyses.  

**1.1 Data normalization**

Data normalization is a primordial step when working with expression data because raw counts do not necessarily reflect real expression measures of the genes since there are technical differences in the way the libraries are prepared and sequenced, as well as intrinsic differences in the genes that are translated into more or less mapping reads. Particularly, there are *within-sample effects* that are the differences between genes in the same sample, such as their **length** (the longer the gene, the more reads it will have) and **GC content**, factors that contribute to variations in their counts. On the other hand, *between-sample effects* are differences between samples such as the **sequencing depth**, i.e., the total number of molecules sequenced, and the **library size**, i.e., the total number of reads of each sample [1].

These variables lead to virtually different mRNA amounts but of course are not due to the biological or treatment conditions of interest (such as nicotine administration in this example) so in order to remove, or at least, to minimize this technical bias and obtain measures comparable and consistent across samples, raw counts must be normalized by these factors. The data that we'll use in this case are already normalized in `assays(rse_gene)$logcounts`. Specifically, the assay contains counts per million (CPM), also known as reads per million (RPM), one basic gene expression unit that only normalizes by the sequencing depth and is computed by dividing the read counts of a gene in a sample by a scaling factor given by the total mapping reads of the sample per million [2]:

$$CPM = \frac{read \ \ counts \ \ of \ \ gene \ \ \times \ \ 10^6 }{Total \ \ mapping \ \ reads \ \ of \ \ sample}$$ 


As outlined in [**Data overview and download**](##Data overview and download), the scaling factors were obtained with `calcNormFactors()` applying the Trimmed Mean of M-Values (TMM) method, the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("edgeR")` package's default normalization method that assumes that most genes are not differentially expressed. The effective library sizes of the samples and the $CPM$ of each observation were computed with the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("edgeR")` function `cpm()` setting the `log` argument to `TRUE` and `prior.count` to 0.5 to receive values in $log_2(CPM+0.5)$.

After data normalization and scaling, we’d expect the read counts to follow a Norm distribution, something we can confirm comparing the counts' distribution before and after the normalization; consider both datasets contain the exact same genes. 

```{r "Data preparation", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)

## Plots of the distribution of genes' counts before and after normalization 

## Raw counts
counts_data <- data.frame(counts=as.vector(assays(rse_gene_nic)$counts))
plot <- ggplot(counts_data, aes(x=counts)) +
    geom_histogram(colour="black", fill="lightgray") +
    labs(x='read counts', y='Frecuency') +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0.5,1,0.2,1), "cm")) 
ggsave(filename = 'plots/01_Data_preparation/Hist_raw_counts.pdf', height = 3, width = 4)
plot

## Normalized counts
logcounts_data <- data.frame(logcounts=as.vector(assays(rse_gene_nic)$logcounts))
plot <- ggplot(logcounts_data, aes(x=logcounts)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour="darkgray", fill="lightgray") +
    theme_classic() +
    geom_density(fill="#69b3a2", alpha=0.3) +
    labs(x='log(CPM+0.5)', y='Frecuency') +
    theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0.5,1,0.2,1), "cm")) 
ggsave(filename = 'plots/01_Data_preparation/Hist_logcounts.pdf', height = 3, width = 4)
plot

```

As presented, after data transformation, we can now see a more widespread distribution of the counts, but note that most of them are zeros in the first plot (the one with the raw counts) and those low counts remain even after normalization, corresponding to counts below 0 in the second plot. That is because we haven't filtered the low or zero-expressed genes. 


**1.2 Gene filtering**

Low-expressed or non-expressed genes in many samples are not of biological interest in a study of differential expression because they don't inform about the gene expression changes and they are, by definition, not differentially expressed, so we have to drop them using `filterByExpr()` from `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("edgeR")` that only keeps genes with at least *K* $CPM$ in *n* samples and with a minimum total number of counts across all samples.

```{r,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Normalized counts and filtered genes

## Retain genes that passed filtering step
rse_gene_filt <- rse_gene_nic[rowData(rse_gene_nic)$retained_after_feature_filtering==TRUE,]

filt_logcounts_data <- data.frame(logcounts=as.vector(assays(rse_gene_filt)$logcounts))
plot <- ggplot(filt_logcounts_data, aes(x=logcounts)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour="darkgray", fill="lightgray") +
    theme_classic() +
    geom_density(fill="#69b3a2", alpha=0.3) +
    labs(x='log(CPM+0.5)', y='Frecuency') +
    theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0.5,1,0.2,1), "cm")) 
ggsave(filename = 'plots/01_Data_preparation/Hist_filt_logcounts.pdf', height = 3, width = 4)
plot


```

In this third plot we can observe a curve that is closer (though not completely) to a Norm distribution and with less low-expressed genes. 

With the object `rse_gene_filt` we can proceed to perform downstream analyses. 


### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis {-}
The first formal step that we will be performing is the sample exploration. This crucial initial part of the analysis consists of an examination of differences and relationships between Quality-Control (QC) metrics of the samples from different groups in order to identify poor-quality samples that must be removed before DEA. After that, we will evaluate the similarities and grouping (not clustering) of the samples by their gene expression variation through a Dimensionality Reduction analysis. Finally, the sample variables in the meta-data also need to be analyzed and filtered based on the percentage of gene expression variance that they explain for each gene. 


**2.1 Quality Control Analysis**

First we have to explore and compare the the quality-control metrics of the samples in the different groups given by covariates such as age, sex, pregnancy state, group, plate and flowcell. See [**Sample Information**](###Sample Information) for the description of the variables.

<p class="comment">
***Why is that relevant?*** 
As you could imagine, technical and methodological differences in all the steps that were carried out during the experimental stages are potential sources of variation in the quality of the samples. Just imagine all that could have been gone wrong or unexpected while experimenting with mice, during the sampling, in the RNA extraction using different batches, when treating samples in different mediums, when preparing libraries in different plates and sequencing in different flowcells. Moreover, the inherent features of the mice from which the samples come from such as age, tissue, sex and pregnancy state could also affect the samples' metrics if, for example, they were separately analyzed and processed.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> the metrics were computed with the unprocessed datasets (neither filtered nor normalized) to preserve the original estimates of the samples.
</div>

*1.2 Evaluate QC metrics for groups of samples*

Fortunately, we can identify to some extent possible factors that could have influenced on the quality of the samples, as well as isolated samples that are problematic. To do that, we will create boxplots that present the distribution of the samples' metrics separating them by sample variables. 

```{r "QCA",  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Hmisc)

library(stringr)
library(cowplot)

## Define QC metrics of interest
qc_metrics <- c('mitoRate', 'overallMapRate', 'totalAssignedGene', 'rRNA_rate', 'sum', 'detected', 'ERCCsumLogErr')

## Define sample variables of interest
sample_variables <- c('Group', 'Age', 'Sex', 'Pregnancy', 'plate', 'flowcell')


## Function to create boxplots of QC metrics for groups of samples

QC_boxplots <- function(qc_metric, sample_var){
    
    ## Define colors of levels depending on the sample variable
    if (sample_var=="Group"){
        colors=c('Control'='brown2', 'Experimental'='deepskyblue3')
    }
    else if (sample_var=="Age"){
        colors=c('Adult'='slateblue3', 'Pup'='yellow3')
    }
    else if (sample_var=="Sex"){
        colors=c('F'='hotpink1', 'M'='dodgerblue')
    }
    else if (sample_var=='Pregnancy'){
        colors=c('Yes'='darkorchid3', 'No'='darkolivegreen4')
    }
    else if (sample_var=='plate'){
        colors=c('Plate1'='darkorange', 'Plate2'='lightskyblue', 'Plate3'='deeppink1')
    }
    else if (sample_var=='flowcell'){
        colors=c('HKCG7DSXX'='chartreuse2','HKCMHDSXX'='magenta', 'HKCNKDSXX'='turquoise3', 
                 'HKCTMDSXX'='tomato')
    }
    
    ## Axis labels
    x_label=capitalize(sample_var)
    y_label=str_replace_all(qc_metric, c("_"=""))
    
    ## x-axis text angle and position
    if (sample_var=='flowcell'){
        x_axis_angle = 18
        x_axis_hjust = 0.5
        x_axis_vjust = 0.7
        x_axis_size = 4
    }
    else {
        x_axis_angle = 0
        x_axis_hjust = 0.5
        x_axis_vjust = 0.5

Initially, when we separate samples by Age, we can appreciate a clear segregation of adult and pup samples in <mark style= "background-color: #FCF3CF"> <span style="font-family: monospace"> mitoRate</span> </mark>, with higher mitochondrial rates for adult samples and thus, these are lower quality samples than the pup ones. We can also see that pup samples have higher <mark style= "background-color: #FCF3CF"> <span style="font-family: monospace"> totalAssignedGene</span> </mark>, again, being higher quality tha adult samples. The samples are very similar in the rest of the QC metrics.
These differences must be taken into account because they guide further sample separation by Age, which is necessary to avoid finding sample differnces driven by QC and not by gene expression changes.
